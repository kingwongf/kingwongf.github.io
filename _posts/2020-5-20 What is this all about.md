title: What is this all about
---

## Hello and welcome


 For several years I have accumulated couple pet projects, mainly involves ML approaches to finance, systematic investing, asset allocation... e.g. how **NOT** to lose money with codes ha.
 With over 40 repos/ projects, this also gives me the chance to organise and revist 
 - the ideas I have tried to implement
 - ML tools I found useful
 - testing other's ideas with full or partial replications
 - concepts, algos I always revised before an interview, 
 - project submissions for interviews

### Blog post future releases
I will try to post at least twice a week. Writing about the repos I already have, and sandwiching new ideas in between.

#### Exisiting Repos
