title: What is this all about
---

## Hello and welcome


 For several years I have accumulated couple pet projects, mainly involves ML approaches to finance, systematic investing, asset allocation... e.g. how **NOT** to lose money with codes ha.
 With over 40 repos/ projects, this also gives me the chance to organise and revist 
 - the ideas I have tried to implement
 - ML tools I found useful
 - concepts, algos I always revised before an interview, 
 - project submissions for interviews

### Blog post future releases
I will try to post at least twice a week. Writing about the repos I already have, and sandwiching new ideas in between.

#### Exisiting Repos
- combining VAR and LSTM in predicting indices returns, inspired by @cerlymarco and Adaptive Portfolio Asset Allocation Optimization with Deep Learning 2018 [repo](https://github.com/kingwongf/var_lstm_mkts) [paper] (http://www.thinkmind.org/download.php?articleid=intsys_v11_n12_2018_3)

- forex carry trades, building a portfolio of long-short currencies with high-low carry [repo] (https://github.com/kingwongf/fxCarryPortfolio)
- implementing @robcarver17 book, "Systematic Trading" with ETFs [repo] (https://github.com/kingwongf/ig_trading_project)
- asset allocation with boostrapping covariance matrix, Black Litterman model and hierarchical risk parity [repo] (https://github.com/kingwongf/assetAllocation) [inspired by Gautier Marti's blog] (http://gautier.marti.ai/qfin/2018/10/02/hierarchical-risk-parity-part-1.html)
- applying the model used by famous Bill Benter, the math prof who made $1B in horse race betting in equities market
[repo] (https://github.com/kingwongf/logitQuantProject) [paper] (https://www.gwern.net/docs/statistics/decision/1994-benter.pdf)
- three different approaches to pairs trading, 1. spread 2. copula 3. xgb [repo] (https://github.com/kingwongf/pairsTrading)
- Look mum no hands! A trading infrastruture with a ML stock picker that run fully auto on Google Cloud Platform [repo] (https://github.com/kingwongf/tradeBot)
- a hackathon submission, investing with a XGB classifier trained with alternative data [repo] (https://github.com/kingwongf/hackathonAftermath)
- implementing ML tools such as the meta-labelling from Marcos Lopez de Prado's [book] (Advances in Financial Machine Learning), not very helpful without tick data [repo] (https://github.com/kingwongf/FinanceML2)
- another hackathon where alternative data is useful for pairs trading [repo] (https://github.com/kingwongf/pairstrading_hackathon)
- basic algos I review before interviews [repo] (https://github.com/kingwongf/basic_algos)
- me trying to learn q, not an expert [repo] (https://github.com/kingwongf/q_test)

#### Future ideas
- GANs in asset allocation/ portfolio construction [paper] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.10578.pdf)
- revisiting my MSc thesis on structural breaks with Hidden Markov Model, various nueral networks
- sequential boostrapping, why and why not
- _italics_
- **bold**
- `code()`
